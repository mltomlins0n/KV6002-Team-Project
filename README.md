# KV6002-Team-Project
Team Project and Professionalism KV6002

This is for the group tasks, NOT each member's subsystems.

This branch will be used for the project as a whole, and each member's branch will be merged into this one to create the final product.
Clone this to your own branch, work on it, then upload to your own branch. 

***Do not overwrite the project on the master branch until we merge all our work together.***
